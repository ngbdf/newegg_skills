  Calculate the recommended PSU wattage for a PC build using Newegg's CPU/GPU
  wattage APIs plus fixed power tables for other components.
  Use this skill whenever users ask: "what PSU do I need?", "how many watts
  for my build?", "is my power supply enough?", "calculate power for my PC",
  or describe PC components (CPU + GPU + RAM + storage) and want to know what
  power supply to buy. Trigger even if the user hasn't explicitly mentioned PSU —
  wattage is the natural next question once someone lists their components.

# Newegg PSU Wattage Calculator

Intelligently collects component information through **adaptive menus**, then
calculates total wattage via live Newegg CPU/GPU wattage tables + fixed tables.

**Always run `scripts/calculate_psu.py` for the calculation — never calculate wattage
yourself from the fallback tables at the bottom of this file "as a shortcut."** Those tables
exist ONLY for the rare case the script genuinely cannot run (e.g. no bash/python available in
this environment). If you do fall back to manual math, you MUST still follow the same
"don't guess, say so" rule the script follows (see the box at the end of the fallback section) —
mapping an unrecognized string like "魔改ITX定制版" to the nearest-sounding table entry
("Mini-ITX" just because it contains "ITX") is exactly the bug the script was fixed to avoid, and
doing it by hand reproduces the same wrong result with none of the script's warnings.

`scripts/calculate_psu.py` fetches the CPU and GPU wattage tables from the
`website-www-tool` endpoint (`apis.newegg.com/ex-mcp/...`, stateless JSON-RPC, no auth)
and sends `x-skill: newegg-psu-calculator` on every request. Nothing to install or
register; if a fetch fails the script degrades to a warning in `warnings[]` rather than
guessing a wattage.

**Core principle**: Be smart about what to ask. If the user already mentioned
components, skip those questions. Combine remaining unknowns into as few
`AskUserQuestion` calls as possible. Vary question wording based on context.

---

## Phase 0 — Parse the user's message first

Before asking anything, extract whatever components the user has already mentioned:

- CPU model or brand → mark as known
- GPU model or brand → mark as known
- RAM size/type → mark as known
- Storage config → mark as known
- Any other component mention → note it

Then proceed to collect only the **missing** information.

**Examples of smart extraction:**
- "I have a Ryzen 7 9800X3D and RTX 5080" → CPU ✓ GPU ✓, only ask RAM + storage
- "I'm thinking about an RTX 4090, haven't decided on the rest" → GPU ✓, ask CPU + RAM + storage
- "No idea what PSU I need" → ask everything
- "i9-14900K + 64GB DDR5 + 2 SSDs" → CPU ✓ RAM ✓ SSD ✓, only ask GPU

---

## Phase 1 — Collect unknowns via AskUserQuestion

Group missing components into **at most 2 AskUserQuestion calls**.
This ≤2-round limit applies **only to collecting parts** (Phase 1). It does **not**
forbid a Phase 3 optional follow-up (e.g. asking whether the user wants a higher-wattage link).

### Grouping strategy

- **Round A** (core): CPU (if unknown) + GPU (if unknown) — **must be one call**.
  Never split Round A into separate CPU-only then GPU-only turns when both are unknown.
- **Round B** (peripherals): RAM + storage (if unknown)
- If only 1 or 2 things are missing, combine them all into 1 call.
- If everything is already known, skip directly to Phase 2.
- **Threadripper / HEDT** (e.g. Threadripper, Threadripper PRO): if motherboard form
  factor is unknown, ask for it in the same round when possible; if still unknown,
  use `SSI CEB` or `SSI EEB` (150W), **not** silent consumer ATX. Menu "Other" Threadripper
  labels are model examples only — not a motherboard special-case by themselves.

### Adaptive question wording

Vary the question text to match context — do NOT use the same fixed wording every time.

**CPU question variants** (pick the most fitting):
- "Which CPU are you planning to use?" (general)
- "You haven't decided on a CPU yet — pick one:" (when user said they haven't decided)
- "What CPU?" (casual, when user is already in spec-listing mode)
- "Besides [known components], which CPU are you going with?" (when some components are known)

**GPU question variants**:
- "Which discrete GPU are you using?"
- "Have you picked a GPU? Choose one:"
- "What's your GPU?"
- "Paired with [known CPU], which GPU are you planning?"

**RAM question variants**:
- "How are you configuring your RAM?"
- "How much RAM?"
- "RAM capacity and generation?"

**Storage question variants**:
- "What's your storage setup?"
- "Storage configuration?"
- "SSD only, or SSD + HDD?"

## Phase 2 — Build the JSON spec and run the script

Map all selections to the JSON spec format and run:

```bash
python3 <skill_base_dir>/scripts/calculate_psu.py '<json_spec>'
```

**Mapping guide:**

| Selection | JSON field | Value |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Ryzen 7 9800X3D | `cpu` | `"Ryzen 7 9800X3D"` |
| RTX 5080 | `gpu` | `"RTX 5080"` |
| 2 GPUs | `gpu_count` | `2` |
| ATX (default) | `mb` | `"ATX"` (if omitted, script defaults ATX — **label as default** in Phase 3) |
| Threadripper, mb unknown | `mb` | `"SSI CEB"` or `"SSI EEB"` (prefer asking first) |
| 16GB DDR5 × 2 | `ram` + `ram_count` | `"16GB DDR5"`, `2` |
| SSD 1TB+ | `ssd` | `"1TB+"` |
| 2 × SSD 1TB+ | `ssd` + `ssd_count` | `"1TB+"`, `2` |
| HDD 7200RPM | `hdd` | `"7200RPM 3.5\""` |
| No discrete GPU / iGPU / 无独显 / 核显 / none / Not decided yet | `gpu` | **Omit `gpu`**, or `""`, or pass the phrase (script maps known phrases → 0W). Do **not** invent a discrete model. |
| User said "no GPU" in free text not in the script list | — | Prefer omit `gpu` / `""` / a known phrase rather than a prose string that may only warn |

**Example:**
```bash
python3 /path/to/scripts/calculate_psu.py \
  '{"cpu":"Ryzen 7 9800X3D","gpu":"RTX 5080","mb":"ATX","ram":"16GB DDR5","ram_count":2,"ssd":"1TB+"}'
```

## Phase 3 — Present results

Script JSON fields (use these; do not invent numbers):

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `total_watts` | Component sum |
| `headroom_watts` | `total_watts × 1.2` |
| `recommended_psu_watts` | **Sole main recommendation** (catalog tier) |
| `catalog_floor_applied` | `true` when headroom &lt; 550 but rec is 550 |
| `optional_higher_tier_watts` | Next tier above main (for verbal mention / later link only) |
| `recommendation_note` | Wording guidance — follow it. Now also carries a live-data caveat (wattages come from a live table and can shift slightly between queries) — relay that in your own words once, don't ignore it. |
| `shop_url` | Newegg "product list" (category-search) link at the same wattage — the same URL that was previously shown alone as the fallback. **Always show this too**, not only when `recommended_products` is empty — see the table format below. |
| `recommended_products` | 0–5 real 80+ Gold-or-better PSUs at the recommended tier, each with `name`, `price`, `currency`, `link` (`newegg.com/p/<item#>`, UTM-tagged). Render as a numbered Markdown table — see "Recommended-products table format" below — never as inline bullets. |
| `warnings[]` | Any component the script couldn't confidently identify (unrecognized motherboard/RAM/SSD/HDD/optical string, a non-numeric count, etc.) — see below. |

**Always surface `warnings[]` to the user when non-empty**, even briefly. A component the script
couldn't identify still affects the total (RAM: excluded entirely; SSD/HDD/optical: assumed a
stated default; motherboard: assumed ATX or SSI CEB with a note). Silently dropping the warning
defeats the point of the script producing one — the user should know a wattage might be
under/over-stated for a part it couldn't confidently parse, ideally with a quick follow-up
question to confirm what they actually meant.

### Recommended-products table format

Same numbered-table convention as `newegg-pc-builder-v2`'s component table and
`newegg-gaming-pc-finder`'s results table — a plain "name — $price" bullet list is not enough
once there can be up to 5 rows. When `recommended_products` is non-empty, render **up to the
first 5** as:

```markdown
| # | Power Supply | Price |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Thermaltake Toughpower GT 850W 80 Plus Gold ATX 3.1](https://www.newegg.com/p/1HU-0014-006W8?Item=1HU-0014-006W8&utm_source=claude&utm_medium=ai_skill&utm_campaign=psu-calculator&utm_content=newegg-psu-calculator) | $79.99 |
| 2 | [Cooler Master MWE V4 850W 80 PLUS Gold Fully Modular](https://www.newegg.com/p/17-171-248?Item=17-171-248&utm_source=claude&utm_medium=ai_skill&utm_campaign=psu-calculator&utm_content=newegg-psu-calculator) | $139.99 |

| 5 | [darkFlash DG850 850W 80 PLUS Gold Fully Modular](https://www.newegg.com/p/17-950-002?Item=17-950-002&utm_source=claude&utm_medium=ai_skill&utm_campaign=psu-calculator&utm_content=newegg-psu-calculator) | $74.99 |

More options: [Browse all {recommended_psu_watts}W Gold+ power supplies]({shop_url})
```

Rules:
- Row order = the order `recommended_products` came back in (already Best-Selling-ranked); never re-sort by price.
- `#` is a plain 1-5 rank, not the item number.
- Product name is the full `name` field turned into a Markdown hyperlink on `link` — never truncate or paraphrase it, and never drop the `$` + `price` column.
- Fewer than 5 entries → render only that many rows, still as a table (never pad with fake rows).
- `recommended_products` empty → skip the table entirely and use `shop_url` alone: "See Newegg's {recommended_psu_watts}W Gold+ power supplies: [link](shop_url)".
- **The `shop_url` "More options" line always appears**, table or no table — it's the same product-list page previously shown as the lone fallback link; the table doesn't replace it, it supplements it.

### Hard rules — ticket #14 (main rec / wording / link must align)

1. **Main recommendation** = `recommended_psu_watts` only. Never treat a higher tier as the primary pick.
2. **First shop link** = `shop_url` (or build URL with the **same** wattage) — this is the same product-list link shown as the "More options" line even when the `recommended_products` table is also shown. Forbidden: main says 550W but link is `d=650W`, or main says 750W while copy pushes 650W as the buy target.
3. You may **verbally** mention `optional_higher_tier_watts` for upgrade headroom (one short sentence). That mention is **not** a second recommendation and must not get a link yet.
4. **End of first reply:** ask if they want a higher-wattage shop link. Give a second link **only after** the user agrees.
5. Do **not** dump multiple conflicting wattages + multiple links in the first reply.

### Hard rules — ticket #15 (550 floor wording)

1. Keep **550W** as the default minimum purchase tier (do not change script floor to 450/500).
2. When `catalog_floor_applied` is `true` (typical iGPU / low-draw builds ~150–210W):
   - **Do not** say the 550W pick “已含 20% 余量” / “already includes 20% safety margin” as if 550 ≈ draw×1.2.
   - **Do** say: after ×1.2 the need is still well below 550; **550W is the starting catalog tier** we recommend for modular Gold availability/quality.
   - Optional: user may choose a lower-wattage PSU themselves; **our shop link stays at 550W**.
3. When `catalog_floor_applied` is `false`, you may say the tier includes ~20% headroom then rounds up to the next catalog tier — still keep main rec and first link identical.
4. Prefer `recommendation_note` from the script when unsure.

### Presentation order

1. **Component breakdown table** — type, name, watts, count × subtotal  
   - If motherboard was not specified by the user, label it as **ATX (default)** (or whatever default the script used).
2. **Total system draw** — `total_watts` (optionally show `headroom_watts`)
3. **Recommended PSU** — `recommended_psu_watts` only, with #15-compliant wording
4. **PSU tiers** (must match `PSU_TIERS` in `calculate_psu.py`): 550 · 650 · 750 · 850 · 1000 · 1200 · 1600  
   - Guidance: 550–750 Gold modular OK; 850+ prefer Gold minimum; 1000+ Platinum when budget allows.
5. **PCIe connector note** — for RTX 5000 series: must have PCIe 5.0 16-pin (600W native)
6. **Newegg product table + product-list link** — per "Recommended-products table format" above:
   the top-5 `recommended_products` table (when non-empty) plus the `shop_url` "More options" link
   always shown together; `shop_url` alone (no table) when `recommended_products` is empty. Either
   way, wattage must equal the main recommendation.
7. Optional one-line higher-tier mention + **ask** before any second link
8. **Existing PSU comparison:** only if the user clearly stated an existing PSU **in this turn**. Never invent “you already have a 750W PSU.”

## Fallback wattage tables (for manual calculation ONLY IF the script genuinely cannot run)

**This is a last resort, not a shortcut.** Try `scripts/calculate_psu.py` first, always. Only use
these tables when bash/python is completely unavailable in this environment.

> **Hard rule if you must use these tables manually:** match a component string to one of the
> categories below ONLY when it clearly and unambiguously names that category (e.g. the user
> literally typed "Mini-ITX", or "ATX"). If the string doesn't clearly match anything here —
> garbled text, a custom/modified board name, a phrase you don't recognize, anything you'd have
> to guess at — do NOT pick the nearest-sounding or nearest-substring entry. Instead: say plainly
> that you couldn't identify that component, assume **ATX (70W)** for motherboard (or **SSI CEB
> 150W** if the CPU is Threadripper/HEDT) as a stated fallback, and tell the user which part you
> couldn't confidently place. This mirrors exactly what `calculate_psu.py`'s `warnings[]` does —
> manual mode must not silently do worse than the script.
